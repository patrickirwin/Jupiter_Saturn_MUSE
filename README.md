# Jupiter_Saturn_MUSE
Data files relevant to paper on analysis of MUSE ammonia observations of Jupiter and Saturn submitted to JGR planets.

Main smoothed cubes, shown in Fig. 1, have already been uploaded to Zenodo with the DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12634418.

Data for all most other figures are contained in figureX.txt (ASCII)files. Exceptions to this are:

Fig. 4 data is contained in fig4frames.fits. FITS files contains the backplanes: 
  latitude,
  longitude,
  zenith angle,
  solar zenith angle,
  reflectivity at 619 nm,
  Trans_CH4,
  tau_CH4,
  p_cloud,
  reflectivity at 647 nm,
  Trans_NH3,
  tau_NH3,
  f_NH3 (ppm).

Fig. 5 data is contained in fig5frames.fits. FITS files contains the backplanes:
  latitude,
  longitude,
  zenith angle,
  solar zenith angle,
  CH4 column abundance,
  p_cloud,
  alpha(p) scaled HILL f_NH3 (ppm),
  NH3 column abundance,
  FIT f_NH3 (ppm),
  alpha(p) scaled FIT f_NH3 (ppm).

Fig. 6 data already contained in fig5frames.fits - column 160.

Data for Figs. 14 and 15 are contained in the FITS files:
  project_fits_2016-03-09_0.fits,
  project_fits_2016-04-01_1.fits,
  project_fits_2020-03-23_0.fits.

  These FITS files contain the following backplanes:
    latitude,
    longitude,
    zenith angle,
    solar zenith angle,
    Red part of colour image,
    Green part of colour image,
    Blue part of colour image,
    f_NH3,
    p_cloud.

Data for Fig. 17 already included in project_fits_2020-03-23_0.fits. All that's been changed is that f_NH3 has been multiplied by 2.0/p_cloud.

Fig. 18 data already contained in fig5frames.fits - column 138.

Fig. 19 data already contained in project_fits_2020-03-23_0.fits.

Fig. 21 data is contained in fig21frames.fits. FITS file has same backplanes as fig4frames.fits.

Fig. 22 data is contained in fig22frames.fits. FITS file has same backplanes as fig5frames.fits.
